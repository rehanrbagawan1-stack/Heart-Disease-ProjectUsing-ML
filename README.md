# Heart Disease Risk Classification Using Clinical Patient Data

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **machine learning classification model** to predict the **risk of heart disease** using clinical and lifestyle patient data.  
The goal is to understand patterns in health indicators and evaluate model performance using proper ML techniques.

This project covers the **complete ML workflow**:  
data exploration → preprocessing → encoding → balancing → modeling → evaluation.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.  
Early prediction using patient health data can help in **preventive healthcare and timely treatment**.

**Objective:**  
Predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on clinical features.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains patient health and lifestyle information such as:

- Gender  
- Exercise Habits  
- Smoking  
- Family Heart Disease  
- Diabetes  
- High Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol Levels (HDL & LDL)  
- Alcohol Consumption  
- Stress Level  
- Heart Disease Status (Target Variable)

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Exploration
- Understanding dataset structure
- Checking data types
- Identifying missing values

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis
- Relationship between features and target variable
- Identifying patterns and trends

### 3️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables using **Get Dummies**
- Separating **features (X)** and **target (y)**

### 4️⃣ Data Balancing
- Addressing class imbalance
- Ensuring fair model learning

### 5️⃣ Model Building
- Training classification models
- Fitting model on training data

### 6️⃣ Model Evaluation
- Performance evaluation on training and test data
- Metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Comparison between train and test performance
